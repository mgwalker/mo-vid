      <h2>Vaccinations</h2>
      <p>
        An average of <strong>12,643</strong> vaccine
        doses have been administered per day for the previous 7 days.
      </p>

      <h2>New cases</h2>
      <p>
        There have been an average of <strong>10,800</strong> new
        cases per day for the previous 7 days. This number includes infections
        confirmed by PCR tests as well as probable cases indicated by antigen
        tests.
      </p>
      <img src="charts/totalPositive.png" />

      <p>
        There have been an average of 8,502 new
        confirmed cases per day for the previous 7 days. These cases are the
        result of positive PCR tests, which are are more sensitive to the virus
        and therefore more accurate. However, not everyone receives a PCR test.
      </p>

      <p>
        There have been an average of 2,298 new
        suspected cases per day for the previous 7 days. These are the result of
        positive antigen tests, which are not as sensitive as PCR tests. If
        someone has a positive antigen test and later receives a positive PCR
        test, they are removed from the "suspected" count and added to the
        "confirmed" count.
      </p>

      <p>
        The positivity rate of PCR tests over the last 7 days is 35.1%, with an average of 25,748 PCR tests administered per day. The
        positivity rate of antigen tests over the last 7 days is 21.4% with an average of 12,993 antigen tests administered per day.
      </p>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently 3,738 people hospitalized with
        COVID-19.
      </p>

      <p>699 people are in intensive care.</p>

      <p>
        Starting January 18, 2022, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior
        Services no longer reports the number of people on ventilators.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the last 7 days, an average of 4 people
        have died from COVID-19 each day. Note that death reporting can be
        delayed, so tracking this number over a longer duration will help to
        understand what is happening in the state.
