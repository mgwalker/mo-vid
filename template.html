      <h1>Missouri COVID data</h1>
      <p>
        The data on this page was updated <strong>{{ updated }}</strong>. For
        the values that are averages over 7 days, the start date is
        <strong>{{ start }}</strong> and the end date is
        <strong>{{ end }}</strong>. The original data comes from the
        <a

          >Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h2>Vaccinations</h2>
      <p>
        An average of <strong>{{ vaccinations_7_day_average }}</strong> vaccine
        doses have been administered per day for the previous 7 days.
      </p>

      <h2>New cases</h2>
      <p>
        There have been an average of <strong>{{ total_new_cases }}</strong> new
        cases per day for the previous 7 days. This number includes infections
        confirmed by PCR tests as well as probable cases indicated by antigen
        tests.
      </p>

      <p>
        There have been an average of {{ pcr_positive_7_day_average }} new
        confirmed cases per day for the previous 7 days. These cases are the
        result of positive PCR tests, which are are more sensitive to the virus
        and therefore more accurate. However, not everyone receives a PCR test.
      </p>

      <p>
        There have been an average of {{ antigen_positive_7_day_average }} new
        suspected cases per day for the previous 7 days. These are the result of
        positive antigen tests, which are not as sensitive as PCR tests. If
        someone has a positive antigen test and later receives a positive PCR
        test, they are removed from the "suspected" count and added to the
        "confirmed" count.
      </p>

      <p>
        The positivity rate of PCR tests over the last 7 days is {{
        pcr_positivity_7_day_percent }}%, with an average of {{
        pcr_tests_7_day_average }} PCR tests administered per day. The
        positivity rate of antigen tests over the last 7 days is {{
        antigen_positivity_7_day_percent }}% with an average of {{
        antigen_tests_7_day_average }} antigen tests administered per day.
      </p>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently {{ hospitalizations }} people hospitalized with
        COVID-19. Of those, {{ icu }} are in intensive care, and {{ ventilator
        }} are on ventilators.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the last 7 days, an average of {{ deaths_7_day_average }} people
        have died from COVID-19 each day. Note that death reporting can be
        delayed, so tracking this number over a longer duration will help to
        understand what is happening in the state.
